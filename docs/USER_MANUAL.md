# APRS Command User Manual

APRS Command is a cross-platform desktop application for amateur-radio APRS operation. It is designed around safe receive-first operation, clear station display, packet monitoring, weather display, logging, replay, and future controlled transmit workflows.

## What APRS Command Is

APRS Command is an APRS client for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi. It can parse APRS packets, show stations and weather information, prepare offline map data, monitor RF/TNC inputs, and organize messages, objects, alerts, logs, replay data, and diagnostics.

## What APRS Command Can Do

APRS Command can:

- receive APRS packets from APRS-IS
- receive packet data from TCP KISS, Serial KISS, Direwolf, and AGWPE foundations
- parse positions, messages, objects, items, weather, telemetry, status, and capability packets
- show stations on a map
- show a station list
- show raw packet logs
- manage tactical labels
- show weather stations
- prepare offline map cache downloads
- store messages, objects, bulletins, announcements, and queries
- monitor alerts and geofences
- run replay, simulation, and training flows without live transmit

## What APRS Command Does Not Do By Default

APRS Command does not transmit by default. It does not enable APRS-IS transmit, RF transmit, beaconing, iGate, digipeater, object transmit, message transmit, weather beaconing, REST API, WebSocket streams, file hooks, or plugins by default.

## Important Transmit Safety Warning

You are responsible for legal amateur-radio operation. Do not enable transmit until you understand your callsign, SSID, path, beacon interval, RF hardware, APRS-IS settings, and local rules. Test receive-only first.

## System Requirements

Recommended:

- .NET 10 SDK for source builds
- Windows, macOS, Linux, or Raspberry Pi 5/Linux ARM64
- user-writable storage for logs, maps, exports, replay, and configuration
- optional internet access for APRS-IS receive and online maps
- optional serial or TCP access for TNC/Direwolf/AGWPE receive

## Installing APRS Command

Packaged installers are planned for a future release. For now, use a published folder from `artifacts/publish/<runtime-identifier>/` or run from source:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Aprs.Desktop
```

See `docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` for platform steps.

## First Launch

On first launch, APRS Command opens to a map-first desktop shell. The main map is the primary workspace, the station list is on the right, the packet monitor is below the map, and feature tabs are in the lower-right area.

## First-Run Setup

Open Settings, then First Run. Review:

- application data folder
- log folder
- map cache folder
- export folder
- station profile placeholder
- APRS-IS receive placeholder
- RF/TNC placeholder
- transmit-disabled safety defaults

Do not enable transmit during first-run setup.

## Main Screen Overview

The main screen is arranged for monitoring:

- map in the center
- station list on the right
- raw packet monitor below the map
- lower-right tabs for Messages, Objects, Weather, Events, Event Bus, Replay, RF Diagnostics, Alerts, Geofence, Simulation, Training, Files, and Settings
- status bar for application status

## In-App Help

Click Help in the application header to open the APRS Command Help window. The Help window lists topics such as User Manual, Quick Start, setup guides, Safety and Transmit Guide, Troubleshooting, and Glossary. Choose a topic from the list, or use the search box to filter by topic title or document content.

Help documents are copied into the published application under `docs/`, so they are available offline where practical. Development runs fall back to the repository `docs/` folder.

## Map Overview

The map shows station markers, object markers, weather marker preparation, selected station details, and offline map cache preparation. Select a marker to view details. If the map is blank, check storage, provider settings, internet access, and offline tile downloads.

## Station List Overview

The station list shows heard stations, display names, symbols, age state, packet source, speed, course, comments, and status text where available. Selecting a row updates the selected station details.

## Packet Monitor Overview

The packet monitor shows raw APRS packets and log entries. Use it to verify receive paths before trusting the map. Search and filter by packet text, direction, source, and packet type where available.

## Messages Overview

The Messages area organizes private messages, drafts, outbox entries, ACK/retry status, bulletins, announcements, and queries. Message transmit remains disabled until explicitly configured through safe transmit paths.

## Objects Overview

The Objects area shows APRS objects and items. Locally created object drafts can be edited and previewed, but object transmit is not automatic. Remote-owned objects should not be silently adopted or moved.

## Weather Overview

The Weather area displays APRS weather packets and future local weather station observations. Weather beacon transmit is disabled by default. Weather data may be marked stale if it stops updating.

## Events and Event Bus Overview

Events and Event Bus areas show internal application events, decoded packet events, and extension-ready event flow. These views help troubleshoot what the app received or processed.

## Replay Overview

Replay allows recorded packet data to be reviewed. Replay and simulation data are source-tagged and cannot bypass transmit safety.

## RF Diagnostics Overview

RF Diagnostics shows receive and transport information for KISS, Direwolf, Serial KISS, AGWPE, and RF-related foundations. Use receive-only testing before enabling any RF transmit feature.

## Alerts Overview

Alerts and geofences can monitor station activity, packet conditions, and area enter/exit conditions. Alerts do not transmit packets by themselves.

## Settings Overview

Settings contains first-run setup, station placeholders, safety review areas, map/cache settings, weather setup foundations, file hooks, plugins, and other configuration panels as they are implemented.

## Logs and Exports Overview

APRS Command stores packet logs, decoded event logs, exports, file hook data, replay files, and backups under the configured application data folder. Do not put credentials in exported examples or support logs.

## Where Files Are Stored

The application data folder contains:

- `config/`
- `logs/`
- `packet-logs/`
- `event-logs/`
- `maps/`
- `map-cache/`
- `exports/`
- `file-hooks/`
- `plugins/`
- `backups/`
- `training/`
- `replay/`

## How to Safely Shut Down

1. Stop APRS-IS, RF/TNC, replay, simulation, or weather receive inputs if they are running.
2. Let packet processing settle.
3. Close APRS Command.
4. Wait for the window to close.
5. Unplug serial devices or removable storage only after the app exits.

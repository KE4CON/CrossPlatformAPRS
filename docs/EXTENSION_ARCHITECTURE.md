# Extension Architecture

APRS Command keeps internal application models separate from external integration contracts.

The extension architecture is built around stable public DTOs, source tagging, event notifications, and central transmit safety.

## Layers

```text
External tools
  REST clients / WebSocket dashboards / file tools / plugins
        |
        v
Public contracts
  AprsCommand.Contracts DTOs
        |
        v
Application boundary services
  Local REST API / WebSocket streams / file hooks / plugin driver framework
        |
        v
Internal services
  station database / weather display / messaging / objects / alerts / diagnostics
        |
        v
Core and transport
  APRS parser / APRS-IS / KISS / AGWPE / GPS / weather drivers
```

## Internal Services

Internal services own application behavior. They may change as APRS Command grows and should not be exposed directly to external integrations.

Examples:

- station database
- weather display service
- message store
- object manager
- alert rules
- raw packet log
- diagnostics
- training and simulation

## Public Contracts Layer

`AprsCommand.Contracts` is the stable external shape. It contains JSON-friendly DTOs with schema versions and source metadata.

External integrations should map to DTOs rather than reference mutable internal service models.

## Internal Event Bus

The event bus is notification-only.

It feeds:

- local API diagnostics
- WebSocket streams
- file export hooks
- plugin callbacks
- developer tools

It is not a command bus and not a transmit path.

## Data Flow In

```text
External source
  -> public DTO or documented file
  -> validation
  -> source tagging
  -> service-layer accept/reject
  -> internal event bus notification
  -> UI/view models observe application state
```

External data may come from REST, file import, plugin/driver input, replay, simulation, or manual tools.

## Data Flow Out

```text
Internal service state
  -> DTO mapping
  -> REST response / WebSocket envelope / file export / plugin callback
  -> external tool
```

Outgoing integration data should include schema version and source metadata.

## Central Transmit Safety

No extension surface bypasses transmit safety.

REST requests, WebSocket messages, file imports, plugin events, and driver updates cannot transmit directly. Future transmit-capable requests must pass explicit operator settings, permissions, validation, and central transmit safety checks.

## Source Tagging

All received, generated, imported, replayed, simulated, training, plugin, API, and file data should carry source metadata.

This allows APRS Command to distinguish:

- live APRS-IS data
- RF/TNC data
- local API data
- file imports
- plugins
- weather drivers
- GPS sources
- replay or simulation data

## UI Coupling

Avalonia views should bind to view models and application services. Views should not start transports, file watchers, plugin loaders, or transmit paths directly.
